Dear Sir;

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) students of Surigao del Norte State University (SNSU), have successfully completed the development phase of our thesis project titled **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Event of the University."**

Incorporating the valuable recommendations from our proposal defense panel members (Mr. Renz M. Buctuan, MIT; Mr. Robert R. Bacarro, MECE, MBA; and Ms. Unife O. Cagas, DTE), we have developed a fully functional system that addresses the challenges of traditional attendance monitoring methods.

**System Overview:**

Our developed system features the following key functionalities:

1. **Multi-Factor Verification System**
   - QR Code scanning for event access
   - GPS location tracking to verify physical presence
   - Selfie verification with event-specific backgrounds to prevent proxy attendance
   - Digital signature capture for authentication

2. **Automated Event Management**
   - Event creation and management dashboard
   - Automated QR code generation for each event
   - Real-time attendance monitoring and updates
   - Student information auto-population (name, course, year level)

3. **Integrated Analytics Dashboard**
   - Real-time attendance statistics and trends
   - Visual analytics including histograms showing check-in patterns
   - Peak attendance time analysis
   - Automated anomaly detection for suspicious activities

4. **Reporting and Data Export**
   - Downloadable attendance reports in university-standard format (PDF/CSV)
   - Individual student photos included in attendance sheets
   - Comprehensive system logs for audit trails
   - Customizable report generation

With this in mind, we respectfully request your permission to:

1. **Deploy the Event Attendance System** for pilot testing during upcoming university events, specifically those organized by the University Student Council (USC).

2. **Conduct User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** with actual event participants, including students, faculty, staff, and event organizers to validate system functionality and usability.

3. **Gather real-time feedback** from system users during the pilot deployment phase to assess performance, security, and reliability under actual operating conditions.

4. **Monitor system performance** including response time, concurrent user handling, GPS accuracy, and QR code scanning efficiency during live events.

5. **Provide training sessions** to USC members and event organizers on system administration, event creation, QR code generation, and report generation.

**Proposed Deployment Schedule:**

- **Phase 1:** System installation and configuration (1 week)
- **Phase 2:** Training sessions for administrators and organizers (3 days)
- **Phase 3:** Pilot testing during 2-3 upcoming USC events (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 4:** Data collection and evaluation (1 week)
- **Phase 5:** System refinement based on feedback (1 week)

**Technical Requirements:**

The system is built on modern, secure technology stack:

- **Backend:** Next.js with TypeScript for robust server-side processing
- **Database:** PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM for secure data management
- **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary for photo and signature storage
- **Location Services:** GPS/Geolocation API for attendance verification
- **Security:** JWT authentication, encrypted QR codes, and role-based access control

**Data Privacy and Security Assurances:**

We guarantee that:

- All student data will be encrypted and stored securely
- Access to the system will be role-based and authenticated
- Personal information (photos, location data, signatures) will be handled in compliance with data privacy regulations
- System logs will track all activities for accountability and transparency
- Regular security audits will be conducted during the deployment phase
- Data backup and recovery mechanisms are in place

**Expected Benefits:**

The deployment of this system will provide:

- **Elimination of attendance fraud** through multi-factor verification
- **Significant time reduction** in attendance recording and processing
- **Real-time monitoring capabilities** for event organizers
- **Automated report generation** reducing administrative workload
- **Data-driven insights** through integrated analytics
- **Scalable solution** applicable to various university events

We believe that this pilot deployment is crucial for validating our research findings and demonstrating the practical benefits of our proposed solution. The success of this deployment will provide empirical evidence for our thesis and potentially offer SNSU a reliable, long-term solution for event attendance monitoring.

We assure you that throughout the deployment process, we will:

- Ensure minimal disruption to event operations
- Provide immediate technical support during events
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of the deployment process
- Present regular progress reports to the university administration
- Address any issues or concerns promptly and professionally

Your approval and support for this deployment phase are essential to completing our research and contributing a valuable tool to our university community. We are fully committed to ensuring the successful implementation and evaluation of this system.

Thank you very much for considering our request. We are available to discuss any questions or concerns you may have and to present a detailed demonstration of the system at your convenience.

We look forward to your favorable response and the opportunity to serve SNSU through this innovative research project.

Respectfully yours,
