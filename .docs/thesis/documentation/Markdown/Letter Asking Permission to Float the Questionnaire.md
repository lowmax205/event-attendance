Dear Sir;

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) students of Surigao del Norte State University (SNSU), are conducting a research study titled **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Event of the University"** as part of our thesis requirements.

Following our initial data gathering phase and in response to the recommendations from our proposal defense panel, we have developed a comprehensive evaluation instrument to assess the usability, efficiency, security, and analytical capabilities of our proposed system. This questionnaire is designed to gather valuable feedback from students, faculty, staff, and event organizers regarding their experiences and expectations for event attendance monitoring.

In this regard, we respectfully request your permission to:

1. **Distribute survey questionnaires** to students across various year levels and programs to evaluate their perspectives on the current attendance monitoring process and their expectations for a digital solution.

2. **Conduct structured interviews** with University Student Council (USC) members, event organizers, and administrative personnel to gain deeper insights into operational challenges and requirements for event management.

3. **Administer system evaluation surveys** to assess the proposed system's features, including QR code scanning, GPS location verification, selfie authentication, and real-time analytics dashboard.

The questionnaire covers four main evaluation areas:

- System Usability & User Experience
- Efficiency & Performance
- Security & Fraud Prevention
- Analytics & Reporting Features

We assure you that:

- All participation will be voluntary and anonymous
- Respondent data will be treated with strict confidentiality
- The gathered information will be used solely for academic research purposes
- Results will be properly documented and made available to the university administration
- The study complies with ethical research standards and data privacy regulations

We believe that the feedback gathered through this instrument will significantly contribute to developing a system that truly addresses the needs of our university community and enhances the efficiency of event attendance monitoring at SNSU.

Your approval of this request would be invaluable to the success of our research. We are prepared to coordinate with your office regarding the schedule and logistics of data collection to ensure minimal disruption to academic activities.

Thank you very much for considering our request. We look forward to your favorable response and guidance.

Respectfully yours,

NILO JR. OLANG
