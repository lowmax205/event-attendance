Dear Sir;

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) student of Surigao del Norte State University (SNSU), have selected the title “A Comprehensive Mobile-Based Approach to School Event Attendance Monitoring” for our research proposal, as part of the requirement for our Thesis project. We believe that this research holds significant potential to provide valuable insights that can benefit various event management, including school events, by enhancing the efficiency of all campus events.

With this in mind, we kindly request your permission to allow us to gather information necessary for our research. We plan to conduct this by administering questionnaires and supplementing them with interviews. Through this approach, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing processes, which will enable us to effectively apply into our proposed system.

Your approval of this request would be greatly appreciated, as it would contribute significantly to the success of our research endeavor. We assure you that all gathered information will be handled with utmost confidentiality and used solely for academic purposes.

Thank you very much for considering our request. We look forward to your favorable response.

Sincerely:

NILO JR. OLANG
