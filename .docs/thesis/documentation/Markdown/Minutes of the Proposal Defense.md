**Suggestion/Recommendation:**

During the defense held at SNSU, the panel gave the following suggestions to improve the study:

*Mr. Renz M. Buctuan, MIT (Panelist)* suggest that when a student takes their attendance photo, the system should immediately upload it and let them know it went through. After scanning the event’s QR code, the system should ask for permission to find the student’s location so we know they’re really there. If they haven’t signed in yet, a login box should pop up before they can continue. Once they’re logged in, the form should fill in their name, course, and year automatically leaving only the capture photo and a signature to be added by hand. Finally, we should be able to download an attendance sheet in the school’s official format, complete with each student’s photo for easy checking.

*Mr. Robert R. Bacarro, MECE, MBA (Chair)* Change the thesis title to include “Integrated Analytics” so it reads “A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Events of the University”, He also wants an analytics section on the dashboard that shows things like overall attendance trends, busy check-in times, and any unusual activity. This makes it easy for school staff to understand the data at a glance. Lastly, he pointed out some formatting mistakes in our paper things like margins, fonts, and reference style and asked us to fix those to match the university’s guide.

*Ms. Unife O. Cagas, DTE (Panelist)* Update the objective from “System logs report” to “Automated reporting and data exporting” so it sounds more active. On the dashboard, add a simple bar chart (histogram) to show how many students checked in over time. Make sure the dashboard refreshes in real time whenever someone submits their form, so organizers can see live attendance numbers and quickly spot any problems during the event.
