# CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE AND STUDIES

This chapter presents a comprehensive review of relevant literature and studies that provide the theoretical and empirical foundation for the development of a mobile web-based attendance monitoring system with integrated analytics. The review examines both local and foreign research on attendance tracking technologies, biometric authentication, location-based verification, and automated reporting systems in educational settings. The synthesis of these studies highlights the gaps in existing solutions and establishes the need for a comprehensive, multi-factor verification approach to attendance monitoring.

## 2.1 Local and Foreign Studies/Literature

### 2.1.1 RFID and Automated Attendance Tracking Systems

Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology has emerged as one of the most widely adopted automated attendance tracking solutions in educational institutions worldwide. The use of automated monitoring and RFID technologies has significantly improved attendance tracking in educational settings by reducing manual labor and increasing accuracy.

Farag and Abouelela (2022) demonstrated an intelligent system that uses Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) monitoring integrated with RFID technology to monitor student login and logout activities during vehicle boarding, ensuring safety and accountability in school transportation systems. This dual-verification approach combining visual monitoring with RFID detection provides a robust method for tracking student movements and ensuring their safety during school-related transportation.

Similarly, the Activity Attendance Monitoring System (AAMS) developed by Adderley et al. (2020) has been successfully launched to improve attendance tracking using RFID-based student identification cards, providing a more efficient alternative to traditional manual attendance-taking methods. The AAMS system demonstrated significant improvements in attendance processing speed and data accuracy compared to paper-based systems. The efficiency of RFID technology in tracking student attendance has been further confirmed through real-time attendance monitoring systems, in which RFID tags are automatically identified as students enter designated areas, and attendance data is immediately stored in a centralized database for instant access by administrators and educators (Adderley et al., 2020).

Mrabet and Ait Moussa (2020) developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based school attendance system using RFID technology that enables automated student identification and attendance logging. Their system incorporates RFID readers at entry points that automatically detect student ID cards and record attendance without requiring manual intervention. The study demonstrated that RFID-based systems significantly reduce the time required for attendance taking and eliminate common errors associated with manual record-keeping.

However, despite the proven effectiveness of RFID systems, they present certain limitations that affect accessibility and implementation feasibility. The requirement for specialized RFID hardware infrastructure, including RFID readers, tags, and integration equipment, results in high initial investment costs that may be prohibitive for resource-constrained educational institutions. Additionally, RFID systems require each student to possess and consistently carry an RFID-enabled identification card, and lost or damaged cards necessitate replacement costs and administrative overhead.

### 2.1.2 Mobile-Based Attendance Systems and SMS Notification

Recent advancements in mobile-based attendance tracking have significantly eased attendance management procedures by leveraging the widespread availability of smartphones among students and educators. Mobile applications provide accessible, cost-effective alternatives to hardware-intensive RFID systems while maintaining comparable accuracy and efficiency.

Satria et al. (2018) demonstrated the successful establishment of a student attendance system that uses an SMS Gateway to effectively convey real-time attendance information to parents and school administrators. This innovative prototype uses RFID detection at school entry points to automatically identify students, and upon detection, the system immediately sends SMS notifications to registered parent mobile numbers, highlighting the significance of real-time monitoring and communication. The integration of SMS alerts enables parents to receive immediate confirmation of their child's arrival at school, enhancing parental awareness and student safety. This communication mechanism addresses a critical need for parental involvement in monitoring student attendance and punctuality.

Furthermore, mobile applications have been identified as efficient replacements for manual attendance methods, providing comprehensive digital solutions that minimize administrative effort and time consumption (Mulay, 2022). These applications create automatic attendance records, generate reminders for absent students, and provide analytics dashboards that improve communication between educational institutions, parents, and students. Mobile-based systems eliminate the need for paper-based attendance sheets, reduce data entry errors, and enable instant data retrieval for reporting purposes.

Caytuiro-Silva et al. (2024) conducted a comprehensive study on optimizing attendance management in educational institutions through mobile technologies, employing a machine learning and cloud computing approach. Their research demonstrated that integrating cloud databases with mobile attendance applications significantly improves precision and efficiency in attendance tracking. The cloud-based architecture enables real-time synchronization across multiple devices, automatic backup of attendance data, and scalable infrastructure that can accommodate growing student populations without performance degradation.

The study by Caytuiro-Silva et al. (2024) further revealed that web-based attendance management systems incorporating QR code integration and cloud databases can substantially expedite the attendance process by minimizing errors and time consumption. QR codes provide a rapid, contactless method for students to check in at events or classes using their smartphone cameras, eliminating the need for physical contact with shared devices or paper sign-in sheets. This approach proved particularly valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic when contactless solutions were essential for health and safety.

### 2.1.3 Biometric Authentication in Attendance Monitoring

Biometric authentication methods, particularly fingerprint and facial recognition systems, have been extensively investigated for attendance tracking applications due to their high accuracy and difficulty to falsify. Biometric systems provide a significant advantage over traditional methods and even RFID systems by verifying the actual physical presence of the individual rather than merely detecting the presence of an identification card or credential.

One notable study described a facial recognition-based attendance management system that reduces human interaction while effectively resolving scalability issues, posture variation challenges, and lighting condition variations that often plague biometric systems (B et al., 2018). This system improves accuracy in detecting and verifying student identities by utilizing advanced feature identification algorithms and machine learning techniques, even under shifting ambient circumstances such as varying indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, different facial angles, and partial occlusions. The researchers reported that their system achieved high accuracy rates in student identification across diverse environmental conditions, demonstrating the robustness of modern facial recognition technology.

Furthermore, a portable fingerprint-based attendance system based on Raspberry Pi technology has been proposed to track student attendance in real-time, allowing instructors and parents to monitor attendance remotely through web interfaces and mobile applications (Syahrul & Wicaksono, 2020). This innovative system recorded and processed attendance data with a 100% success rate in controlled testing environments, confirming its reliability and trustworthiness for educational institutions. The Raspberry Pi-based implementation demonstrates that cost-effective, small-form-factor computing devices can power sophisticated biometric attendance systems without requiring expensive enterprise hardware.

The combination of facial recognition and fingerprint authentication presents a highly secure alternative to traditional attendance methods, ensuring that only registered students who are physically present are marked as attending. Multi-modal biometric systems that incorporate multiple biometric factors provide enhanced security and accuracy compared to single-factor biometric systems, as they reduce false acceptance rates and increase the difficulty of spoofing or fraudulent attendance.

Several studies have focused on intelligent attendance systems that utilize advanced recognition technology to increase identification accuracy and address sophisticated fraud attempts. Tsai and Li (2022) developed a groundbreaking spatio-temporal human action identification-based system that combines skeletal gait recognition, body silhouette detection, and facial recognition to effectively monitor attendance with unprecedented accuracy. This multi-modal approach provides comprehensive identity verification that is extremely difficult to falsify or circumvent.

This innovative technique proves particularly beneficial for overcoming identity masking issues, such as students wearing face masks to conceal their identity, changing clothes to avoid detection by appearance-based systems, or attempting to use photos or videos to spoof facial recognition systems. Experimental findings showed that this advanced system achieved 83.33% identification accuracy even while students were wearing face masks that covered significant portions of their faces, making it a feasible and robust choice for educational institutions that require extremely precise attendance verification (Tsai & Li, 2022). The system's ability to maintain high accuracy despite facial occlusions demonstrates the value of combining multiple recognition modalities to create resilient verification systems.

### 2.1.4 GPS and Location-Based Attendance Verification

Another significant area of research has focused on incorporating GPS (Global Positioning System) and NFC (Near Field Communication)-based attendance tracking devices, which provide low-cost and efficient options for monitoring attendance while verifying physical presence at designated locations. Location-based verification addresses a critical weakness in many attendance systems: the inability to confirm that a student is actually at the correct physical location for an event or class.

Chiang et al. (2022) proposed a comprehensive GPS and NFC-based attendance monitoring system that allows students to record attendance using their own Android smartphones, thereby avoiding the need for additional technological equipment such as dedicated RFID readers or biometric scanners. This approach significantly reduces implementation costs and leverages devices that students already own and carry daily. The system enables moderators and instructors to track attendance more rapidly than traditional roll-call systems, resulting in considerable reductions in classroom management time that can be redirected toward instructional activities.

Furthermore, the technology automates attendance tracking by recognizing student locations through GPS coordinates and validating their presence within defined geographical boundaries (geofences) without requiring manual input from students or instructors. The system can be configured to automatically mark students as present when they enter a designated area during a specified time window, streamlining the attendance process and eliminating the need for manual check-ins (Chiang et al., 2022).

Vinay et al. (2020) explored the application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology for attendance monitoring in transportation systems, demonstrating that GPS-based tracking can effectively monitor student presence on school vehicles and at various checkpoints throughout campus. Their study emphasized the importance of location verification in ensuring student safety and accountability during school-related transportation and activities.

The integration of GPS verification with other authentication methods creates a multi-layered security approach that simultaneously confirms identity (through biometric or credential-based authentication) and physical presence (through location verification). This combination significantly reduces the potential for attendance fraud, as it requires fraudulent actors to not only obtain valid credentials but also be physically present at the correct location.

However, GPS-based systems face certain technical challenges that must be addressed in implementation. GPS accuracy can be affected by environmental factors such as tall buildings, dense urban areas, indoor locations, and adverse weather conditions. GPS signals may be weak or unavailable in indoor venues, underground locations, or areas with significant physical obstructions. These limitations necessitate the implementation of fallback verification methods or manual override capabilities for situations where GPS verification is unreliable.

### 2.1.5 Rapid Application Development and Educational Technology

The development methodology employed in creating attendance systems significantly impacts the success and sustainability of the final product. Febrifyaning et al. (2021) implemented a smart school management system using the Rapid Application Development (RAD) method for monitoring teacher presence in real-time at Khadijah High School Surabaya. The RAD methodology proved particularly effective for educational technology projects due to its emphasis on rapid prototyping, iterative development, and continuous user feedback.

The study demonstrated that RAD methodologies enable developers to quickly create functional prototypes that can be tested with actual users, allowing for early identification of usability issues and refinement of features based on user feedback. This iterative approach is especially valuable in educational settings where stakeholder input (from students, teachers, administrators, and parents) is critical to creating systems that meet diverse needs and preferences.

Saracostti et al. (2022) explored the implementation of a web-based system to measure, monitor, and promote school engagement strategies in Chilean educational institutions. Their research emphasized the importance of user-centered design and stakeholder involvement throughout the development process to ensure that technology solutions align with the actual needs and workflows of educational institutions rather than imposing external processes that disrupt established practices.

## 2.2 Synthesis of the Review

The comprehensive analysis of related literature and studies reveals several critical themes and insights that inform the development of the proposed Event Attendance System for SNSU. The reviewed studies collectively highlight the importance of automation, accuracy, fraud prevention, and real-time accessibility in attendance tracking systems while also revealing gaps and limitations in existing solutions.

**Integration of Multiple Verification Methods:** The literature demonstrates that single-factor authentication systems, whether based solely on RFID, biometrics, or location, possess inherent vulnerabilities that can be exploited for fraudulent attendance. RFID cards can be borrowed or shared among students, fingerprint scanners can be bypassed in unmonitored environments, and GPS signals can be unreliable in certain conditions. The most effective and secure attendance systems employ multi-factor verification that combines multiple authentication methods to create layered security. The proposed system for SNSU addresses this need by integrating QR code scanning (something you have), GPS location tracking (somewhere you are), and selfie verification (something you are) to create a robust, comprehensive verification process that is significantly more resistant to fraud than single-factor systems.

**Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness:** A significant finding from the literature review is that many technologically advanced attendance systems, particularly those based on RFID or specialized biometric hardware, require substantial financial investment in infrastructure and maintenance. These costs can be prohibitive for educational institutions with limited budgets, particularly in developing regions. The studies by Chiang et al. (2022) and Caytuiro-Silva et al. (2024) demonstrate that mobile-based solutions leveraging students' existing smartphones provide cost-effective alternatives that achieve comparable or superior functionality without requiring expensive specialized equipment. The proposed SNSU system follows this approach by implementing a mobile web-based solution accessible through standard smartphone browsers, eliminating the need for additional hardware purchases or native application downloads.

**Real-Time Monitoring and Communication:** The literature emphasizes the critical importance of real-time attendance monitoring capabilities that enable event organizers and administrators to immediately identify attendance patterns, detect anomalies, and respond to issues as they occur (Satria et al., 2018; Adderley et al., 2020). Traditional paper-based systems and even some digital systems that require batch processing create delays between attendance taking and data availability, reducing their utility for immediate decision-making. The proposed system incorporates real-time updates and analytics dashboards that provide instant visibility into attendance status, enabling proactive event management and timely intervention when issues arise.

**Location-Based Verification:** Research by Chiang et al. (2022) and Vinay et al. (2020) demonstrates that location-based verification using GPS tracking is an effective method for confirming physical presence at events and preventing remote or fraudulent check-ins. GPS verification ensures that students are actually at the designated event venue rather than remotely accessing the attendance system from another location. The integration of geofencing technology creates virtual boundaries around event venues, and the system can automatically verify that check-ins occur within these boundaries. The proposed SNSU system incorporates GPS-based location tracking and geofencing to add this critical layer of verification, significantly reducing the potential for location-based fraud.

**Biometric and Visual Verification:** The studies by Tsai and Li (2022) and B et al. (2018) confirm that biometric authentication through facial recognition and visual verification significantly improves attendance accuracy and fraud prevention. However, traditional biometric systems often require specialized hardware and controlled environments with consistent lighting and positioning. The proposed system addresses this limitation by implementing selfie verification with event-specific backgrounds, which serves multiple purposes: it confirms the student's physical presence through their face, verifies they are at the correct event through the visible background, and creates a visual record that can be reviewed if disputes arise. This approach provides the security benefits of biometric authentication while using the standard cameras built into students' smartphones.

**Cloud Computing and Scalability:** The research by Caytuiro-Silva et al. (2024) emphasizes that cloud-based architectures are essential for modern attendance systems to achieve scalability, reliability, and accessibility. Cloud computing enables centralized data storage that can be accessed from multiple locations and devices, automatic backup and disaster recovery, elastic scaling to handle varying loads (such as high traffic during major events), and integration with other institutional systems through APIs. The proposed SNSU system leverages cloud infrastructure for data storage (PostgreSQL database hosted on cloud servers), media management (Cloudinary for photo storage), and application hosting, ensuring that the system can scale to accommodate university-wide deployment while maintaining performance and reliability.

**Automated Reporting and Analytics:** Multiple studies (Adderley et al., 2020; Caytuiro-Silva et al., 2024; Saracostti et al., 2022) highlight the value of automated reporting capabilities and data analytics in reducing administrative burden and providing insights for decision-making. Traditional manual attendance systems require extensive effort to consolidate data, generate reports, and analyze trends. The reviewed literature demonstrates that automated systems can generate comprehensive reports in various formats (PDF, CSV, Excel), provide visual analytics through charts and graphs, identify patterns and trends over time, and enable data-driven decision-making for event planning and student engagement strategies. The proposed system incorporates these capabilities through an integrated analytics dashboard and automated report generation features.

**User Experience and Adoption:** Research by Febrifyaning et al. (2021) and Saracostti et al. (2022) emphasizes that the success of educational technology systems depends heavily on user experience design and stakeholder acceptance. Systems that are complex, counterintuitive, or disruptive to established workflows often face resistance and poor adoption rates, regardless of their technical capabilities. The literature supports the application of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to create intuitive interfaces, minimize the number of steps required for common tasks, provide clear instructions and feedback, and accommodate users with varying levels of technical proficiency. The proposed SNSU system prioritizes usability through responsive design, streamlined check-in processes, and clear visual guidance to ensure high adoption rates among students and event organizers.

**Addressing Limitations of Existing Systems:** The synthesis of literature reveals that no single existing system comprehensively addresses all the requirements for effective attendance monitoring in educational settings. RFID systems lack visual verification and require expensive infrastructure. Biometric systems may require specialized hardware and controlled environments. GPS-based systems alone cannot verify identity. Mobile applications that require downloads create barriers for users with limited storage or data plans. The proposed Event Attendance System for SNSU addresses these limitations by combining the strengths of multiple approaches—QR codes for rapid initiation, GPS for location verification, selfie capture for visual confirmation, cloud storage for accessibility, and web-based access for universal compatibility—while mitigating their individual weaknesses through multi-factor verification and fail-safe mechanisms.

**Research Gap and Contribution:** Despite the extensive research on individual attendance tracking technologies, there is a notable gap in studies examining comprehensive, multi-factor verification systems specifically designed for event attendance in educational settings that integrate QR code scanning, GPS tracking, and selfie verification within a unified mobile web platform. Most existing studies focus on single verification methods or classroom attendance rather than event attendance, which presents unique challenges including higher volumes of simultaneous check-ins, diverse venue types, and varying security requirements. This study fills that gap by developing and evaluating a comprehensive system specifically designed for school event attendance monitoring with integrated analytics capabilities, providing empirical evidence of its effectiveness through rigorous user evaluation and comparison with traditional manual methods.

By synthesizing insights from these diverse studies and addressing the identified limitations and gaps, the proposed Event Attendance System for SNSU integrates fraud protection through multi-factor verification, location-based verification through GPS and geofencing, real-time performance monitoring through analytics dashboards, cost-effective implementation through mobile web technology, and user-centered design through HCI principles to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for event attendance tracking. The combination of these features positions the system to significantly improve attendance monitoring accuracy, security, and efficiency at SNSU while providing a model that can be adapted for use at other educational institutions facing similar challenges.
