Narciso St., Brgy. Taft, Surigao City

Dear Sir,

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) students of Surigao del Norte State University (SNSU), have selected the title **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Events of the University"** for our research proposal, as part of the requirement for our Thesis project. We believe that this research holds significant potential to provide valuable insights that can benefit various event management activities, including school events, by enhancing the efficiency of all campus events.

With this in mind, we kindly request your permission to allow us to gather information necessary for our research. We plan to conduct this by administering questionnaires and supplementing them with interviews. Through this approach, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing processes, which will enable us to effectively design and implement our proposed system.

Your approval of this request would be greatly appreciated, as it would contribute significantly to the success of our research endeavor. We assure you that all gathered information will be handled with utmost confidentiality and used solely for academic purposes.

Thank you very much for considering our request. We look forward to your favorable response.

## APPENDIX B: Letter Asking Permission to Float the Questionnaire

**March 15, 2025**

**John Baltazar B. Cervantes**
USG President
Surigao del Norte State University Main Campus
Narciso St., Brgy. Taft, Surigao City

Dear Sir,

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year BSCS students of SNSU, are conducting research on **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Events of the University"** as our thesis requirement.

Based on recommendations from our defense panel, we have developed an evaluation instrument to assess our proposed system. We respectfully request permission to:

1. **Distribute survey questionnaires** to BSCS students across all year levels (Phase 1)
2. **Conduct structured interviews** with BSCS student leaders, event organizers, and faculty
3. **Administer system evaluation surveys** to assess QR scanning, GPS verification, selfie authentication, and analytics features

**Phased Approach:**

- **Phase 1:** BSCS students (current request)
- **Phase 2:** All CCIS programs after improvements
- **Phase 3:** University-wide USC events

Our evaluation covers System Usability, Efficiency, Security, and Analytics capabilities. All participation will be voluntary, anonymous, and confidential, with results used solely for academic purposes and properly documented.

This approach allows us to refine the system with targeted feedback before broader deployment. We will coordinate with your office to minimize disruption to academic activities.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your favorable response.

Respectfully yours,

## APPENDIX D: Letter Asking Permission to Deploy the System

**April 15, 2025**

**John Baltazar B. Cervantes**
USG President
Surigao del Norte State University Main Campus
Narciso St., Brgy. Taft, Surigao City

Dear Sir,

**RE: Permission to Deploy Event Attendance Monitoring System**

We have completed our thesis project **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Events of the University"** incorporating recommendations from our defense panel.

**Key Features:**

1. **Multi-Factor Verification:** QR scanning, GPS tracking, selfie verification, digital signatures
2. **Automated Management:** Event creation, QR generation, real-time monitoring
3. **Analytics Dashboard:** Attendance statistics and pattern analysis
4. **Reporting:** PDF/CSV exports with photos and customizable reports

We respectfully request permission to deploy in three phases:

- **Phase 1:** BSCS pilot testing
- **Phase 2:** Expansion to all CCIS programs
- **Phase 3:** University-wide USC events implementation

During deployment, we will conduct user testing, gather feedback, and provide training to organizers. Our system uses Next.js, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, and JWT authentication with strict data privacy protocols.

This approach ensures SNSU receives a robust solution that eliminates attendance fraud, reduces processing time, and provides data-driven insights.

We are available to demonstrate the system and address any questions. Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully yours,

## APPENDIX E: Minutes of Proposal Defense and Final Defense

### E1: Minutes of the Proposal Defense

**Title of the study:** A COMPREHENSIVE MOBILE WEB-BASED ATTENDANCE MONITORING SYSTEM WITH INTEGRATED ANALYTICS FOR SCHOOL EVENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY

**Date of Defense:** April 26, 2025

**Time of Defense:** 8:45 AM – 9:30 AM

**Proponents:**

- Nilo Jr. Olang
- Cricedine P. Peñaranda

**Suggestion/Recommendation:**

During the defense held at SNSU, the panel gave the following suggestions to improve the study:

**Mr. Renz M. Buctuan, MIT (Panelist)** suggested that when a student takes their attendance photo, the system should immediately upload it and let them know it went through. After scanning the event's QR code, the system should ask for permission to find the student's location so we know they're really there. If they haven't signed in yet, a login box should pop up before they can continue. Once they're logged in, the form should fill in their name, course, and year automatically leaving only the capture photo and a signature to be added by hand. Finally, we should be able to download an attendance sheet in the school's official format, complete with each student's photo for easy checking.

**Mr. Robert R. Bacarro, MECE, MBA (Chair)** recommended changing the thesis title to include "Integrated Analytics" so it reads "A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Events of the University." He also wants an analytics section on the dashboard that shows things like overall attendance trends, busy check-in times, and any unusual activity. This makes it easy for school staff to understand the data at a glance. Lastly, he pointed out some formatting mistakes in our paper—things like margins, fonts, and reference style—and asked us to fix those to match the university's guide.

**Ms. Unife O. Cagas, DTE (Panelist)** recommended updating the objective from "System logs report" to "Automated reporting and data exporting" so it sounds more active. On the dashboard, add a simple bar chart (histogram) to show how many students checked in over time. Make sure the dashboard refreshes in real time whenever someone submits their form, so organizers can see live attendance numbers and quickly spot any problems during the event.
