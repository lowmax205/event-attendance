Dear Sir;

**RE: Permission to Deploy Event Attendance Monitoring System**

We have completed our thesis project **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Event of the University"** incorporating recommendations from our defense panel.

**Key Features:**

1. **Multi-Factor Verification:** QR scanning, GPS tracking, selfie verification, digital signatures
2. **Automated Management:** Event creation, QR generation, real-time monitoring
3. **Analytics Dashboard:** Attendance statistics and pattern analysis
4. **Reporting:** PDF/CSV exports with photos and customizable reports

We respectfully request permission to deploy in three phases:

- **Phase 1:** BSCS pilot testing
- **Phase 2:** Expansion to all CCIS programs
- **Phase 3:** University-wide USC events implementation

During deployment, we will conduct user testing, gather feedback, and provide training to organizers. Our system uses Next.js, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, and JWT authentication with strict data privacy protocols.

This approach ensures SNSU receives a robust solution that eliminates attendance fraud, reduces processing time, and provides data-driven insights.

We are available to demonstrate the system and address any questions. Thank you for your consideration.

Respectfully yours,
