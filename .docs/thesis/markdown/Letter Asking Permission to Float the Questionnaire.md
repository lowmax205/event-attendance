Dear Sir;

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) students of Surigao del Norte State University (SNSU), are conducting a research study titled **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Event of the University"** as part of our thesis requirements.

Following our initial data gathering phase and in response to the recommendations from our proposal defense panel, we have developed a comprehensive evaluation instrument to assess the usability, efficiency, security, and analytical capabilities of our proposed system. This questionnaire is designed to gather valuable feedback from students, faculty, staff, and event organizers regarding their experiences and expectations for event attendance monitoring.

In this regard, we respectfully request your permission to:

1. **Distribute survey questionnaires** to Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) students across all year levels as part of our initial evaluation phase (Phase 1). This focused approach will allow us to gather detailed feedback and identify potential issues before expanding to other programs.

2. **Conduct structured interviews** with BSCS student leaders, event organizers, and faculty members to gain deeper insights into operational challenges and requirements for event management within the program.

3. **Administer system evaluation surveys** to BSCS students to assess the proposed system's features, including QR code scanning, GPS location verification, selfie authentication, and real-time analytics dashboard.

**Phased Deployment Strategy:**

Our research follows a systematic three-phase approach:

- **Phase 1 (Current Request)**: Survey and pilot testing with BSCS students to gather initial feedback and identify system improvements.
- **Phase 2 (Future)**: After addressing feedback and fixing bugs discovered in Phase 1, expand to all CCIS programs (BSIT, BSIS, BSIS courses).
- **Phase 3 (Final)**: Following successful CCIS-wide validation, deploy the system for university-wide events organized by the University Student Council (USC).

The questionnaire covers four main evaluation areas:

- System Usability & User Experience
- Efficiency & Performance
- Security & Fraud Prevention
- Analytics & Reporting Features

We assure you that:

- All participation will be voluntary and anonymous
- Respondent data will be treated with strict confidentiality
- The gathered information will be used solely for academic research purposes
- Results will be properly documented and made available to the university administration
- The study complies with ethical research standards and data privacy regulations

We believe that the feedback gathered through this instrument will significantly contribute to developing a robust system. Starting with BSCS students allows us to refine the system with a focused user group before expanding to the broader CCIS community and eventually to university-wide deployment. This phased approach ensures thorough validation at each stage and maximizes the system's effectiveness when fully deployed.

Your approval of this request would be invaluable to the success of our research. We are prepared to coordinate with your office and the CCIS department regarding the schedule and logistics of data collection to ensure minimal disruption to academic activities.

Thank you very much for considering our request. We look forward to your favorable response and guidance.

Respectfully yours,

NILO JR. OLANG
