Dear Sir;

Good Day!

We, the 3rd-year BSCS students of SNSU, are conducting research on **"A Comprehensive Mobile Web-Based Attendance Monitoring System with Integrated Analytics for School Event of the University"** as our thesis requirement.

Based on recommendations from our defense panel, we have developed an evaluation instrument to assess our proposed system. We respectfully request permission to:

1. **Distribute survey questionnaires** to BSCS students across all year levels (Phase 1)
2. **Conduct structured interviews** with BSCS student leaders, event organizers, and faculty
3. **Administer system evaluation surveys** to assess QR scanning, GPS verification, selfie authentication, and analytics features

**Phased Approach:**

- **Phase 1:** BSCS students (current request)
- **Phase 2:** All CCIS programs after improvements
- **Phase 3:** University-wide USC events

Our evaluation covers System Usability, Efficiency, Security, and Analytics capabilities. All participation will be voluntary, anonymous, and confidential, with results used solely for academic purposes and properly documented.

This approach allows us to refine the system with targeted feedback before broader deployment. We will coordinate with your office to minimize disruption to academic activities.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your favorable response.

Respectfully yours,

NILO JR. OLANG CRICEDINE P. PEÃ‘ARANDA
