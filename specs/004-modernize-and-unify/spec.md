# Feature Specification: Unified Dashboard Modernization

**Feature Branch**: `004-modernize-and-unify`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Modernize and unify the Event Attendance System dashboards so admin, moderator, and student experiences share a consistent, polished UI, remove duplicated functionality, and improve maintainability without changing the underlying business capabilities. Business Outcomes: - Clear, cohesive design language across all role-specific dashboards that looks and behaves consistently on desktop and mobile. - Shared dashboard shell/navigation, reusable data visualization widgets, and consolidated table/filter components to reduce duplication. - Improved first-time comprehension for each role through stronger information architecture, contextual empty/loading/error states, and helpful microcopy. Key Problems to Solve: - Current admin/moderator/student dashboard screens use near-duplicate UI components and divergent styling that confuses users. - Repeated hooks, API calls, and local state implementations make maintenance risky and inflate bundle size. - Responsiveness, accessibility, and chart readability need upgrades to match the management & analytics spec (003-complete-the-event)."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Audit all existing admin, moderator, and student dashboard screens.
   -> Catalog duplicated UI, divergent styling, redundant hooks, and inconsistent copy.
2. Define a shared dashboard shell and navigation framework.
   -> Map role-specific content zones and validation for desktop and mobile layouts.
3. Consolidate reusable widgets, tables, filters, and state messaging patterns.
   -> Specify shared data visualization and loading/empty/error components.
4. Align information architecture and microcopy for each role.
   -> Validate that first-time users can understand priority tasks and terminology.
5. Confirm responsiveness, accessibility, and readability upgrades match management & analytics expectations.
   -> Test across breakpoints and assistive technologies before handoff.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Keep navigation, spacing, and typography consistent across all dashboards.
- Reduce duplication by centralizing reusable widgets, tables, and filters.
- Guarantee desktop and mobile parity for critical tasks across roles.
- Provide context-rich empty, loading, and error messaging tuned to each role.
- Record any intentional role-specific differences for future releases.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: We need to confirm the accessibility target before locking the spec in. Which standard should the unified dashboards satisfy? → A: Maintain current baseline only.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A dashboard user (admin, moderator, or student) opens their workspace and immediately understands where to find tasks, key metrics, and actions because the layout, visual language, and messaging match the unified dashboard pattern.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an admin signs in, **When** they land on the dashboard, **Then** they see the shared navigation shell with admin-specific content cards, consistent styling, and clear next steps on desktop and mobile.
2. **Given** a moderator accesses the dashboard, **When** they review attendance items, **Then** they interact with the same consolidated table and filter components with moderator data and contextual helper text.
3. **Given** a student opens their dashboard, **When** no upcoming events exist, **Then** they receive an informative empty state explaining the situation and guiding them to explore other actions.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a role has no active data sources? Provide tailored empty states without breaking layout.
- How does system handle slow or failed data loads? Display unified loading and error components that keep navigation intact.
- What occurs on very small screens or high-zoom accessibility settings? Maintain readability, tap targets, and chart usability.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST deliver a single dashboard shell and navigation pattern shared across admin, moderator, and student experiences.
- **FR-002**: System MUST present role-specific content within the shared shell without duplicating component code or visual styles.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide reusable data visualization widgets that adapt to each role's metrics while preserving consistent styling and legend patterns.
- **FR-004**: System MUST centralize table, filter, and bulk-action components so all roles benefit from the same interaction behavior and affordances.
- **FR-005**: System MUST supply contextual empty, loading, and error states that clarify what is happening and guide users to meaningful next steps.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure dashboards remain usable and visually coherent on common desktop and mobile breakpoints, including assistive technology considerations, while maintaining the existing accessibility baseline without regressions.
- **FR-007**: System MUST streamline duplicated hooks, API calls, and local state management into shared utilities to reduce maintenance risk.
- **FR-008**: System MUST align microcopy, headings, and labels with the management and analytics communication standards defined in 003-complete-the-event.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Dashboard Shell**: The shared layout framework encompassing navigation, global actions, and responsive structure supporting all roles.
- **Role Workspace Zones**: Configurable regions within the shell where role-specific cards, charts, and tables surface prioritized information.
- **Shared UI Component Library**: The collection of reusable widgets (charts, tables, filters, state messages) that enforce consistency and reduce duplication.
