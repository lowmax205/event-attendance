## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-08

- Q: What user management actions should admins be able to perform beyond viewing and changing roles/status? ‚Üí A: Full control: All above + Create new users manually (suspend/reactivate accounts, reset passwords, delete users, create users)
- Q: Should moderators have access to all events system-wide, or only events they created? ‚Üí A: Own events only - Moderators see and manage only events they created
- Q: What Excel format should be supported for data exports? ‚Üí A: Modern .xlsx only (Excel 2007+, smaller file size, better compatibility)
- Q: What chart types should be used for the analytics dashboard visualizations? ‚Üí A: Line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, pie charts for distributions
- Q: What additional analytics metrics should be tracked beyond the basic attendance trends? ‚Üí A: + Department/Course breakdown - Add attendance rates by department and course

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As an administrator**, I need comprehensive management tools to oversee the entire attendance system, so that I can maintain data quality, manage user access, and make informed decisions based on attendance analytics.

The administrator logs into their dashboard and sees an overview of system activity. They can navigate to different management sections:

- User Management: View all registered users, filter by role or status, edit user roles, and manage account access
- Event Management: View all events across the system, edit event details, and generate QR codes
- Attendance Management: View all attendance submissions, filter by status or date, and verify records
- Analytics Dashboard: View visual charts showing attendance trends, event participation rates, and user engagement metrics
- Data Export: Download attendance records in CSV or Excel format for external analysis or reporting

**As a moderator**, I need event and attendance management tools to efficiently handle the events I'm responsible for, so that I can ensure accurate attendance tracking and quick verification.

The moderator accesses their dashboard and manages their assigned events. They can create new events with all necessary details, generate unique QR codes for each event, view attendance submissions in real-time, verify or reject submissions with notes, and export attendance data for their events.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Admin User Management

1. **Given** an admin is logged into their dashboard
   **When** they navigate to the User Management section
   **Then** they see a table of all registered users with columns for name, email, role, and account status

2. **Given** the admin is viewing the user list
   **When** they apply filters by role (Student/Moderator/Admin) or status (Active/Suspended)
   **Then** the table updates to show only users matching the selected criteria

3. **Given** the admin selects a user from the list
   **When** they edit the user's role or account status
   **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately in the user list and the user's access permissions

#### Scenario 2: Event Management

1. **Given** a moderator is logged into their dashboard
   **When** they navigate to Event Management and click "Create Event"
   **Then** they see a form with fields for event name, description, date/time, location, check-in/check-out buffers

2. **Given** the moderator completes the event creation form
   **When** they submit the form
   **Then** a new event is created and a unique QR code is automatically generated

3. **Given** an event exists in the system
   **When** the moderator selects it and clicks "Edit"
   **Then** they can modify event details and the changes are saved with a timestamp

4. **Given** a moderator views an event
   **When** they click "Download QR Code"
   **Then** they receive a printable QR code image file

#### Scenario 3: Attendance Management

1. **Given** a moderator is logged into their dashboard
   **When** they navigate to Attendance Management
   **Then** they see all attendance records for their events with columns for student name, event name, submission time, and verification status

2. **Given** the moderator is viewing attendance records
   **When** they apply filters by event, date range, or verification status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
   **Then** the table updates to show only matching records

3. **Given** the moderator selects a pending attendance record
   **When** they review the submitted photos, signature, and location data
   **Then** they can approve or reject the record and add notes explaining their decision

#### Scenario 4: Analytics Dashboard

1. **Given** an admin is logged into their dashboard
   **When** they navigate to the Analytics section
   **Then** they see visual charts displaying attendance trends over time, event participation rates, and user engagement metrics

2. **Given** the admin is viewing the analytics dashboard
   **When** they select a time period filter (Last 7/30/90 days or All-time)
   **Then** all charts update to reflect data from the selected period

3. **Given** the admin views attendance trends
   **When** they hover over data points on charts
   **Then** they see detailed tooltips with exact values and context

#### Scenario 5: Data Export

1. **Given** a moderator needs to share attendance data externally
   **When** they navigate to their event's attendance records and click "Export to CSV"
   **Then** they download a CSV file containing all attendance data with proper column headers

2. **Given** an admin needs comprehensive attendance reports
   **When** they apply filters (date range, events, status) and click "Export to Excel"
   **Then** they download an Excel file with the filtered attendance data formatted for readability

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when an admin tries to change their own role to a lower permission level?** System should display a warning and require confirmation, or prevent the action entirely to avoid self-lockout.

- **What happens when a moderator tries to edit an event that has already ended?** System should allow editing of event details but display a warning that the event is already completed and changes won't affect past attendance records.

- **What happens when an admin exports a large dataset (thousands of records)?** System should display a loading indicator and potentially process the export in the background, providing a download link when ready.

- **What happens when there are no attendance records matching the applied filters?** System should display a message indicating no records were found and suggest adjusting the filters.

- **What happens when a moderator tries to delete an event that has existing attendance records?** System should prevent deletion and display a message explaining that events with attendance records cannot be deleted to maintain data integrity.

- **What happens when analytics charts have insufficient data for meaningful visualization?** System should display a message indicating insufficient data and suggest a different time period or wait for more data collection.

- **What happens when multiple admins edit the same user account simultaneously?** System uses last-write-wins approach where the most recent update overwrites previous changes. (Note: Optimistic locking deferred to Phase 4 - see FR-068).

- **What happens when a user's role is changed while they are logged in?** System should invalidate their current session and require re-login to refresh their permissions.

- **What happens when export fails due to timeout or server error?** System should display a clear error message and allow the user to retry the export or contact support.

- **What happens when a moderator tries to access an event or attendance record they didn't create?** System should display an access denied message indicating they can only manage their own events and redirect to their event list.
