# Feature Specification: Landing Pages & Authentication Foundation

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-the-foundation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build the foundation and user-facing landing pages for an Event Attendance System. This MVP should include: 1. Landing Pages: A set of modern, responsive landing pages (Home, Events, RoadMap) that explain the system to visitors. 2. Authentication System: A role-based authentication system (Student, Moderator, Administrator) using email and password."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: Does the MVP send any emails during user registration? ‚Üí A: No emails sent - registration is instant and email field is just for login username
- Q: What should be the maximum failed login attempts allowed for rate limiting? ‚Üí A: 5 attempts per hour per email address
- Q: What should the token lifetimes be for JWT access and refresh tokens? ‚Üí A: Access token: 1 hour, Refresh token: 30 days
- Q: Should the MVP include a "Forgot Password" feature? ‚Üí A: No - defer to future feature (out of scope for MVP)
- Q: Can a user be logged in from multiple devices simultaneously? ‚Üí A: No - new login invalidates all previous sessions

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**As a prospective user**, I want to visit the Event Attendance System website to understand what the platform offers, then create an account and complete my profile so I can access role-specific features.

**Journey**:

1. Visitor lands on the Home page and reads about the system's purpose and benefits
2. Visitor explores the Events page to see how event attendance tracking works
3. Visitor checks the RoadMap page to understand upcoming features
4. Visitor clicks "Get Started" or "Login" button, triggering an authentication modal
5. New user registers with email and password, providing their role (Student, Moderator, or Administrator)
6. After successful registration, user is redirected to a profile completion form
7. User fills in academic details (Year, Section, ID Number, Course, Department, Campus, Current Semester)
8. After profile completion, user is redirected to their role-specific dashboard placeholder
9. Returning user logs in with credentials and is immediately redirected to their dashboard

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a visitor on the Home page, **When** they scroll through the content, **Then** they see a clear value proposition, feature highlights, and call-to-action buttons that remain accessible on mobile and desktop

2. **Given** a visitor on the Events page, **When** they read the content, **Then** they understand how event attendance tracking benefits students, moderators, and administrators

3. **Given** a visitor on the RoadMap page, **When** they view the roadmap, **Then** they see planned features organized by development phases or timeline

4. **Given** a visitor clicks "Login" or "Register", **When** the modal appears, **Then** they see a modern form with email and password fields and clear validation feedback

5. **Given** a new user submits valid registration details, **When** registration succeeds, **Then** they are redirected to a profile completion form pre-populated with their email and role

6. **Given** a user on the profile completion form, **When** they submit all required academic details, **Then** their profile is saved and they are redirected to their role-specific dashboard placeholder

7. **Given** a registered user with a complete profile, **When** they log in, **Then** they are redirected directly to their dashboard without seeing the profile form

8. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** they see a clear error message without exposing whether the email exists

9. **Given** a user on mobile device, **When** they access any landing page or authentication modal, **Then** all elements are touch-friendly with minimum 44√ó44px tap targets

10. **Given** a user navigates between landing pages, **When** pages load, **Then** initial content appears within 2 seconds on 3G connection

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a user tries to register with an email that already exists?**  
  System displays an error: "An account with this email already exists. Please log in instead."

- **What happens when a user closes the authentication modal mid-registration?**  
  Registration is not saved; user can reopen modal and start fresh.

- **What happens when a user successfully registers but doesn't complete their profile immediately?**  
  User can log in later and will be redirected to the profile completion form until completed.

- **What happens when a user tries to access a dashboard URL directly without being logged in?**  
  System redirects to the Home page with the login modal automatically opened.

- **What happens when an administrator vs. student completes their profile?**  
  Both complete the same profile form, but are redirected to different dashboard layouts (not implemented in this phase, but URLs differ: /dashboard/student, /dashboard/moderator, /dashboard/admin).

- **What happens when a user enters an invalid email format?**  
  Inline validation shows error immediately on blur: "Please enter a valid email address."

- **What happens when a user's password doesn't meet strength requirements?**  
  Inline validation shows requirements (minimum 8 characters, one uppercase, one number, one special character) with visual indicators.

- **What happens when network request fails during login/registration?**  
  User sees error message: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection and try again."

- **What happens when a user with keyboard-only navigation uses the site?**  
  All interactive elements (buttons, form fields, modal close) are accessible via Tab key and activatable with Enter/Space.

- **What happens when a screen reader user accesses the authentication modal?**  
  Modal announces its purpose, form fields have proper labels, errors are announced, and focus is trapped within the modal.

- **What happens when a user logs in from a new device while already logged in elsewhere?**  
  The new login invalidates all previous sessions; the user is logged out from other devices and must re-authenticate.

- **What happens when a user exceeds rate limit (5 failed login attempts per hour)?**  
  System displays error: "Too many failed attempts. Please try again in [X] minutes." Further login attempts are blocked until the time window expires.
