# Feature Specification: QR-Based Attendance and Role-Based Dashboards

**Feature Branch**: `002-extend-the-event`  
**Created**: October 6, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Extend the Event Attendance System with core attendance functionality and dashboard structure. This phase builds upon the foundation established in Phase 1 (landing pages and authentication) and adds: 3. **QR-based Attendance Form:** A streamlined 3-click attendance process triggered by scanning a QR code: - **Click 1: Verify Location** using the browser's Geolocation API. - **Click 2: Capture Photos** using the device camera (front and back). Images are uploaded to Cloudinary in the path: attendance/{eventId}/{userId}/{timestamp}_{attendanceId}_{front|back}.jpg. - **Click 3: Signature Canvas** for digital signature, saved as transparent PNG and uploaded to Cloudinary in path: attendance/{eventId}/{userId}/{timestamp}_{attendanceId}_signature.png. The form pre-fills user data from their profile and prevents duplicate check-ins. 4. **Role-Based Dashboards:** Create the basic shell layouts and routing for three dashboards (Student, Moderator, Admin). The Student dashboard should display their attendance history and quick access to QR scanning."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What is the acceptable location accuracy radius for verifying a student is at the event venue? ‚Üí A: 100 meters - Medium precision (suitable for campus quad or building cluster)

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What valid range should admins be allowed to set for the default GPS accuracy radius? ‚Üí A: 10-500 meters (Medium - suitable for small campus or event complex)
- Q: What time period filters should the analytics dashboard support? ‚Üí A: All-time + Last 7/30/90 days (standard analytics preset periods)
- Q: How should the system handle events where the check-in buffer extends into the past (e.g., event created with start time in 1 hour but 2-hour buffer)? ‚Üí A: Block event creation (Strict - prevent impossible buffer windows)
- Q: How should students be able to appeal a rejected attendance verification? ‚Üí A: Appeal button on student dashboard with message field (Simple UI addition to student dashboard)
- Q: How should the system transition events from Active to Completed status after they end? ‚Üí A: Immediate on event end (Real-time trigger - requires event listeners/timers)
- Q: Should students with incomplete profiles be allowed to check in to events? ‚Üí A: Block check-in - Prevent students from checking in if their profile is incomplete; display error message directing them to complete profile first
- Q: Should the system support offline mode for attendance check-ins (queue for later submission), or require real-time connectivity? ‚Üí A: Real-time only - Require active internet connection; display error if offline and prevent check-in attempt
- Q: Are events time-bound? Can students check in before or after the scheduled event times? ‚Üí A: Custom buffer windows before/after (configurable per event)
- Q: For this phase, what specific moderator dashboard features are needed? ‚Üí A: Full event control - Create/edit events, manage QR codes, verify attendance, handle disputes, export data

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What export format(s) should the moderator attendance export feature support? ‚Üí A: CSV only (simple, universal compatibility)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

**As a student attending an event**, I need to quickly record my attendance by scanning a QR code, so that I can prove my participation without lengthy manual processes.

The student arrives at an event venue, scans a QR code displayed at the entrance, and completes a simple 3-step verification process: confirming their location, taking two photos (front and back), and providing a digital signature. The system automatically fills in their profile information and prevents them from accidentally checking in twice to the same event.

**As an administrator**, I need to access a centralized dashboard where I can manage events and view attendance data, so that I can oversee the entire attendance system.

**As a moderator**, I need a dashboard that allows me to verify attendance records and manage event-specific tasks, so that I can assist with event operations.

**As a student**, I need to view my attendance history and quickly access the QR scanner, so that I can track my participation and easily check in to new events.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Successful QR-Based Check-In

1. **Given** a student with a completed profile is at an event venue  
   **When** they scan the event's QR code  
   **Then** the attendance form opens with their profile data pre-filled

2. **Given** the attendance form is open  
   **When** the student grants location permission and their location is verified  
   **Then** the system confirms their location matches the event venue

3. **Given** location is verified  
   **When** the student captures their front and back photos  
   **Then** both photos are uploaded and confirmed

4. **Given** photos are uploaded  
   **When** the student provides their digital signature  
   **Then** the attendance record is created and the student receives confirmation

#### Scenario 2: Duplicate Check-In Prevention

1. **Given** a student has already checked in to an event  
   **When** they scan the same event's QR code again  
   **Then** the system displays a message indicating they are already checked in and prevents duplicate submission

#### Scenario 3: Dashboard Access by Role

1. **Given** a user with Student role is authenticated  
   **When** they navigate to their dashboard  
   **Then** they see their attendance history and a QR scanner button

2. **Given** a user with Moderator role is authenticated  
   **When** they navigate to their dashboard  
   **Then** they see event management tools and attendance verification features

3. **Given** a user with Admin role is authenticated  
   **When** they navigate to their dashboard  
   **Then** they see system-wide controls and full attendance data access

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a student denies location permission?** The system should display an error explaining that location verification is required for attendance and offer to retry.
- **What happens when photo capture fails?** The system should allow the user to retry capturing photos and display clear error messages.
- **What happens when a student's profile is incomplete?** The system should prevent check-in and display an error message directing the student to complete their profile first.
- **What happens when network connectivity is lost during check-in?** The system should detect the offline state, display an error message explaining that internet connection is required, and prevent check-in attempt until connectivity is restored.
- **What happens when a QR code is scanned outside the event's time window?** The system should verify the current time is within the event's allowed check-in window (scheduled time plus configurable buffer periods before/after). If outside the window, display an error message with the allowed check-in times.
- **What happens when location verification fails but the student is actually at the venue?** The system should display an error and allow retry. Moderators may need manual verification capability if the issue persists due to GPS inaccuracy beyond the 100-meter radius.
- **What happens when signature canvas is left blank?** The system should require a signature before allowing submission.
- **What happens when a student without the required permissions tries to access moderator or admin dashboards?** The system should display an access denied message and redirect to their appropriate dashboard.
- **What happens when a moderator tries to create an event with a check-in buffer that extends into the past?** The system should block event creation and display a validation error message indicating that the start time minus buffer must be in the future.
